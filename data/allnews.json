        "body": "<p>According to Gaidam, the credit relationship went well until he defaulted at the 11th attempt.</p>
<p>“When I defaulted, which was sometime at the end of August, I began to receive multiple text messages from different sources saying they were Recovery Agents. The agents kept sending threatening messages to all my contact lists including my wife, colleagues, mother-in-law, and uncles. The harassment went further with several threats and curses and that I had been declared ‘wanted’,” Gaidam said.</p>
<p>A Lagos-based Emamoke James similarly had sour tales from NairaPlus loan platform where her spouse submitted her details to acquire N13,500 at a 1.3 per cent interest rate, repayable in seven days. She narrated that “Because of default, the interest rates that have incurred on the debt is about N70,000 and that is not even the issue. But the life-threatening messages and insults are too much, and I have been the one suffering it.”</p>
<p>Currently, there are over 71 unregistered loan apps notorious for defamation, harassment, and breach of data privacy rights.</p>
<p>Among them are: Mint Bag, Link Loan, Ncredit, Nownow, Money Naija, Speedloan, Cashpaddie, Careginance, Nairanaija, Cashrun, ⁠Swiftnaira, Cashhall, Kashkash, Onaira, Kwikcash, Newcredit, Tiger Credit, ⁠Link Loan, Easy Cash, Golden Wallet, Super Money, Cycle Lending Company, We Credit, Fincole NG, Easy Kash and L Credit.</p>
<p>These digital lenders are not registered with FCCPC. They are not on the websites of approved firms.</p>
<p>According to FCCPC, 88 of such illegal firms are on its watchlist, while 47 offending firms have been delisted. There are also 10 such firms enjoying FCCPC’s waivers because they are registered with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p>

        <p>Associate lead at Citizen Gavel, a non-governmental organisation that works on consumer protection matters, Funmi Oderinde, a lawyer, said the organisation has received over 600 complaints about loan app defamation.</p>
<p>She explained that loan app defamation is a criminal offence in Nigeria, adding that such loan apps that engage in spreading damaging information against their customers are liable to imprisonment for at least one year.</p>
<p>“Another law that has been broken by this loan app is the Cybercrime Prohibit and Prevention Act of 2015, which provides a framework for prosecuting cybercrime. It states that any person, who knowingly or intentionally transmits any communication through a computer system or network to bully, threaten or harass another person or place that person in the position of fear of death, violence, or bodily harm, is liable to imprisonment of 10 years and a fine of N25 million.</p>
<p>“This is why we are trying to put out a class action to put an end to loan app defamation in Nigeria. We want to ensure Nigerians will no longer be victims of such illegalities,” she explained.</p>
<p>Oderinde said her organisation has cases of atrocities that are being committed by these loan apps to recover their debts from defaulters.</p>
<p>Her words: “This defamation must stop. At the citizen gavel, we are working with the government to stop this act. We discovered that the atrocities are committed by those apps that are not registered.</p>",
