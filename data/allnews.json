        "body": "In a statement, the rights activist said: “It has become illegal to arrest journalists for cyberstalking, insult, causing annoyance, offensive message and criminal intimidation. Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act, 2015 had criminalised ‘cyberstalking’, ‘insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’ ‘insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’. Specifically, section 24 provided as follows: (a) Any person who, knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter using computer systems or network that (a) is grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene, or menacing character or causes any such message or matter to be so sent; or (b) He knows to be false for causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent: commits an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not more than N7million or imprisonment for a term of not more than 3 years or to both such fine and imprisonment. However, in the cases of Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative (Suit No. ECW/CCJ/APP/53/18) and Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (Suit Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative (Suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/09/19), the Ecowas Court declared section 24 of the Cybercrime Act 2015 illegal and directed the federal government to amend the section to make the law conform with the fundamental rights of Nigerian citizens to freedom of expression guaranteed by section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,1999 and article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. In line with both judgments of the Ecowas Court, the Government of Nigeria has repealed section 24 by removing the provisions relating to ‘cyber stalking’, ‘insult’, ‘causing annoyance’, ‘sending offensive messages’, and ‘criminal intimidation’ from the Cybercrime Act 2015 and replaced same with Section 5 of the Cybercrime Amendment Act which provides as follows: Any person who knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter using computer systems.",

        "title": "Human Rights lawyer, Festus Ogun, speaks with IMOLEAYO OYEDEYI on the contentious 2024 Cybercrime Act and its legal lacunas that can be negatively exploited. What is your take on the 2024 Cybercrime Act and how has it been interpreted so far, especially by the Nigerian Police? The amendment to the Cybercrime Act was done hurriedly and in secrecy. When was the bill sponsored? Was there public debate and interrogation of its provisions and peculiarities? Typical of the National Assembly under Senator Godswill Akpabio, the bill was hurriedly passed into law to generate more revenue for the government despite the excruciating economic pain suffered by our countrymen daily. Some lawyers have described the Cybercrime Act as bad for the Nigeria Police. Is it that it will work against the interest of the police? Some may jubilate that the problematic Section 24 of the Act has been amended. Still, I would rather hold the view that the purported amendment to the section was merely a Greek gift. The wording of the newly amended version is still porous and open to abuse by security agencies. In the past, Section 24(1) of the Act made it an offence to send a message via a computer system that was “grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character”, or to send a message or cause any such message or matter to be so sent; or to send a message, knowing it to be false for “causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another” or to cause such a message to be sent. The nebulous and vague nature of the law gave room for security agencies, particularly the police, to clamp down on journalists and vocal citizens. However, by the amendment to Section 24(1), cyberstalking is now limited to pornographic content or contents a sender knows to be false, to cause a breakdown of law and order, or to pose a threat to life. I agree that the amendment has taken away the very nebulous provisions. I am, however, afraid that “to cause a breakdown of law and order” used in that provision can also be weaponised by the police. If not through strongly implementing the Cybercrime Acts, how else can the Federal Government sanitise the country’s cyberspace given the huge threat many people say it poses to national security? Our leadership is the greatest threat to national peace and security. The laws should be implemented, no doubt. But the implementation should be done while upholding the rule of law. We also need to reform the justice sector, particularly the court system, to achieve proper implementation. Recklessly violating human rights under the guise of implementation is not the way out. The effect of human rights violations and disrespect of the rule of law is telling on our economic climate and portfolio of foreign direct investment. Before President Bola Tinubu’s intervention, the CBN recently issued a circular notifying Nigerians of the implementation of Section 44 of the 2024 Cybercrime Acts, which imposes a 0.5 per cent cyber security levy on Nigerians. What is your take on the new levy?",
